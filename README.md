# Revora-Contracts

Soroban contract for revenue-share offerings and blacklist management.

## Contract interface summary (for integrators)

*- **Issuer authority:** Only the offering issuer can register offerings, report revenue, set concentration limits, set rounding mode, and report concentration for that offering. The contract does not implement a separate "platform admin" role; all offering-level actions are issuer-authorized.
- **Issuer transferability:** Issuer control can be securely transferred via a two-step propose/accept flow. The old issuer proposes, the new issuer accepts. Either party can abort before acceptance (old issuer cancels, or new issuer simply doesn't accept). This prevents accidental loss of control and griefing attacks.
- **Blacklist authority:** Any address that passes `require_auth` can add/remove blacklist entries for any token. The contract does not restrict blacklist edits to the issuer. Integrators must enforce policy off-chain or via a wrapper if only the issuer should manage the blacklist.ontract:** `RevoraRevenueShare`

### Public methods

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Auth | Description |
|--------|------------|---------|------|-------------|
| `register_offering` | `issuer: Address`, `token: Address`, `revenue_share_bps: u32` | `Result<(), RevoraError>` | issuer | Register a revenue-share offering. Fails with `InvalidRevenueShareBps` if `revenue_share_bps > 10000`. |
| `get_offering` | `issuer: Address`, `token: Address` | `Option<Offering>` | — | Fetch one offering by issuer and token. |
| `list_offerings` | `issuer: Address` | `Vec<Address>` | — | List offering tokens for issuer (first page only, up to 20). |
| `report_revenue` | `issuer: Address`, `token: Address`, `amount: i128`, `period_id: u64` | `Result<(), RevoraError>` | issuer | Emit a revenue report; event includes current blacklist. Updates audit summary. Fails with `ConcentrationLimitExceeded` if holder concentration enforcement is on and reported concentration exceeds limit. |
| `get_offering_count` | `issuer: Address` | `u32` | — | Total offerings registered by issuer. |
| `get_offerings_page` | `issuer: Address`, `start: u32`, `limit: u32` | `(Vec<Offering>, Option<u32>)` | — | Paginated offerings. `limit` capped at 20. `next_cursor` is `Some(next_start)` or `None`. |
| `blacklist_add` | `caller: Address`, `token: Address`, `investor: Address` | — | caller | Add investor to blacklist for token. Idempotent. |
| `blacklist_remove` | `caller: Address`, `token: Address`, `investor: Address` | — | caller | Remove investor from blacklist. Idempotent. |
| `is_blacklisted` | `token: Address`, `investor: Address` | `bool` | — | Whether investor is blacklisted for token. |

| `set_concentration_limit` | `issuer: Address`, `token: Address`, `max_bps: u32`, `enforce: bool` | `Result<(), RevoraError>` | issuer | Set per-offering max single-holder concentration (bps). 0 = disabled. If `enforce` is true, `report_revenue` fails when reported concentration > `max_bps`. Offering must exist. |
| `report_concentration` | `issuer: Address`, `token: Address`, `concentration_bps: u32` | `Result<(), RevoraError>` | issuer | Report current top-holder concentration (bps). Emits `conc_warn` if over configured limit. |

| `set_rounding_mode` | `issuer: Address`, `token: Address`, `mode: RoundingMode` | `Result<(), RevoraError>` | issuer | Set rounding mode for share calculations. Offering must exist. |
| `get_rounding_mode` | `issuer: Address`, `token: Address` | `RoundingMode` | — | Get rounding mode (default Truncation if not set). |
| `compute_share` | `amount: i128`, `revenue_share_bps: u32`, `mode: RoundingMode` | `i128` | — | Compute share of amount at given bps with given rounding. Bounds: 0 ≤ result ≤ amount. |

| `cancel_issuer_transfer` | `token: Address` | `Result<(), RevoraError>` | current issuer | Cancel a pending issuer transfer before it's accepted. |
| `get_pending_issuer_transfer` | `token: Address` | `Option<Address>` | — | Get the proposed new issuer for a pending transfer, if any. |

### Types

- **Offering:** `{ issuer: Address, token: Address, revenue_share_bps: u32 }`
- **ConcentrationLimitConfig:** `{ max_bps: u32, enforce: bool }` — per-offering concentration guardrail.
- **AuditSummary:** `{ total_revenue: i128, report_count: u64 }` — per-offering audit log summary.
- **RoundingMode:** `Truncation` (0) or `RoundHalfUp` (1) — used by `compute_share` and per-offering default.

### Error codes (RevoraError)

| Code | Name | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | `InvalidRevenueShareBps` | `revenue_share_bps` > 10000. |
| 2 | `LimitReached` | Reserved / offering not found (e.g. for set_concentration_limit, set_rounding_mode). |
| 3 | `ConcentrationLimitExceeded` | Holder concentration exceeds configured limit and enforcement is on; `report_revenue` rejected. |
| 12 | `IssuerTransferPending` | A transfer is already pending for this offering. |
| 13 | `NoTransferPending` | No transfer is pending for this offering (accept/cancel failed). |
| 14 | `UnauthorizedTransferAccept` | Caller is not authorized to accept this transfer. |

Auth failures (e.g. wrong signer) are signaled by host/panic, not `RevoraError`. Use `try_register_offering`, `try_report_revenue`, and similar `try_*` client methods to receive contract errors as `Result`.

### Events

| Topic / name | Payload | When |
|--------------|---------|------|
| `offer_reg` | `(issuer), (token, revenue_share_bps)` | After `register_offering`. |
| `rev_rep` | `(issuer, token), (amount, period_id, blacklist_vec)` | After `report_revenue`. |
| `bl_add` | `(token, caller), investor` | After `blacklist_add`. |
| `bl_rem` | `(token, caller), investor` | After `blacklist_remove`. |
| `conc_warn` | `(issuer, token), (concentration_bps, limit_bps)` | When `report_concentration` is called and reported concentration exceeds configured limit (warning only; enforce blocks at `report_revenue`). |
| `iss_prop` | `(token), (current_issuer, proposed_new_issuer)` | When `propose_issuer_transfer` is called. |
| `iss_acc` | `(token), (old_issuer, new_issuer)` | When `accept_issuer_transfer` completes the transfer. |
| `iss_canc` | `(token), (current_issuer, proposed_new_issuer)` | When `cancel_issuer_transfer` revokes a pending transfer. |

### Call patterns and limits

- **Pagination:** Use `get_offerings_page(issuer, start, limit)` with `start = 0` then `start = next_cursor` until `next_cursor` is `None`. Max page size 20.
- **Off-chain:** Prefer small page sizes and bounded blacklist sizes for predictable gas. See storage/gas tests in `src/test.rs` for stress behavior.
- **Holder concentration:** Concentration is not computed on-chain (no token balance reads). Issuer or indexer calls `report_concentration(issuer, token, bps)` with the current top-holder share in bps; the contract stores it and enforces or warns based on `set_concentration_limit`. Use `try_report_revenue` when enforcement may be enabled.
- **Rounding:** Use `compute_share(amount, revenue_share_bps, mode)` for consistent distribution math. Per-offering default is `get_rounding_mode(issuer, token)` (Truncation if unset). Sum of shares must not exceed total; both modes keep result in [0, amount].
- **Issuer Transfer:** See [ISSUER_TRANSFER.md](./ISSUER_TRANSFER.md) for comprehensive documentation on securely transferring issuer control via the two-step propose/accept flow.

## Security review checklist (contracts)

This section enumerates key security assumptions, trust boundaries, and mitigations for the Revora contracts. It is kept in sync with the implementation; see `src/lib.rs` and `src/test.rs` for the code that enforces these behaviors.

### Assumptions and trust boundaries

- **Issuer authority:** Only the offering issuer can register offerings, report revenue, set concentration limits, set rounding mode, and report concentration for that offering. The contract does not implement a separate “platform admin” role; all offering-level actions are issuer-authorized.
- **Blacklist authority:** Any address that passes `require_auth` can add/remove blacklist entries for any token. The contract does not restrict blacklist edits to the issuer. Integrators must enforce policy off-chain or via a wrapper if only the issuer should manage the blacklist.
- **Concentration data:** Holder concentration is not derived on-chain. The contract trusts the value passed to `report_concentration`. Enforcing or warning is based on this reported value; manipulation of the reported value can bypass the guardrail.
- **Revenue reports:** The contract does not verify that reported revenue amounts are correct or consistent with any external source. It only records and aggregates them for the audit summary and emits events.

### Threat model and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Auth misuse / wrong signer** | All state-changing entrypoints call `require_auth` on the appropriate address. Auth failures cause host panic; use `try_*` client methods to handle errors. Tests: `blacklist_add_requires_auth`, `blacklist_remove_requires_auth`. |
| **Issuer transfer security** | Two-step propose/accept flow prevents accidental loss of control. Old issuer must propose, new issuer must explicitly accept. Either can abort (old cancels, new doesn't accept). Current issuer verified via reverse lookup on all auth checks. Tests: `issuer_transfer_*` (35 tests covering happy path, abuse attempts, edge cases, and integration). |
| **Incorrect math (overflow, rounding)** | Revenue share bps is capped at 10000. `compute_share` uses checked arithmetic where applicable and clamps output to [0, amount]. Rounding modes (Truncation, RoundHalfUp) are documented and tested. Tests: `compute_share_*`, `register_offering_rejects_bps_over_10000`. |
| **Concentration guardrail bypass** | Enforcement is applied in `report_revenue` using the last value set by `report_concentration`. If concentration is not reported or is reported low, enforcement cannot block. Design: guardrail is advisory or best-effort unless the issuer reliably reports concentration before each report. Tests: concentration_enforce_blocks_report_revenue_when_over_limit, concentration_near_threshold_boundary. |
| **Audit summary consistency** | Summary is updated atomically in `report_revenue` (total_revenue += amount, report_count += 1). No corrections or overrides are supported; each report is additive. Tests: audit_summary_aggregates_revenue_and_count, audit_summary_per_offering_isolation. |
| **Storage / gas exhaustion** | Large blacklists and many offerings increase read/write cost. Pagination (max 20 per page) and stress tests document behavior. No unbounded loops over user-controlled collections except the blacklist map (bounded by who is added). Tests: storage_stress_*, gas_characterization_*. |
| **Upgradeability** | The contract is not upgradeable in this codebase; deployment is a single WASM with no proxy pattern. Any upgrade would require a new deployment and migration of off-chain indexing. |

### Limitations of on-chain checks

- **Holder concentration:** Token balances are held in the token contract. This contract does not call the token contract to compute concentration; it only stores and compares a reported value. Full concentration checks require off-chain indexing of balances and optional submission via `report_concentration`.
- **Revenue authenticity:** There is no on-chain verification that reported revenue matches actual payments or external systems. Auditability is via events and the on-chain audit summary; integrity of the source data is an off-chain concern.

### Build and test

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo test
```

### Contributor guidelines (reduce merge conflicts)

- Use feature branches per change (e.g. `feature/structured-error-codes`, `feature/storage-limit-negative-tests`).
- Tests in `src/test.rs` are grouped by area (pagination, blacklist, structured errors, storage stress, gas characterization). Add new tests in the relevant section so parallel PRs touch different regions.
- Keep the contract interface summary above in sync when adding or changing entrypoints or events.
